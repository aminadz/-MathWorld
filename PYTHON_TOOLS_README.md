### 3. `test_games.py`
**Game logic testing utility**

**Features:**
- Test arithmetic operations
- Validate Sudoku logic
- Test memory game mechanics
- Verify CrossMath equations
- Generate test reports

**Usage:**
```bash
python test_games.py
```

**Key Functions:**
- `test_arithmetic_operations()` - Test basic math
- `test_sudoku_logic()` - Validate Sudoku rules
- `test_memory_game_logic()` - Test memory mechanics
- `test_crossmath_logic()` - Verify equation solving

## Installation

1. **Install Python 3.7+** (if not already installed)

2. **Install required packages** (optional):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the tools**:
```bash
# Run all tools
python mathworld_manager.py
python game_analyzer.py
python test_games.py
```

## Output Files

The tools generate several output files:

- `games_export.json` - Exported games data
- `game_analysis_report.txt` - Detailed analysis report
- `test_results.json` - Test results and metrics
- `backups/` - Platform backup files

## Features by Tool

### MathWorld Manager

- ✅ Performance metrics
- ✅ Error detection

## Customization

### Adding New Games
1. Add game data to `script.js`
2. Run `mathworld_manager.py` to extract new data
3. Use `game_analyzer.py` to analyze the new game
4. Test with `test_games.py`

### Modifying Analysis
Edit the analysis functions in `game_analyzer.py`:
- `analyze_game_complexity()` - Adjust complexity scoring
- `calculate_educational_value()` - Modify educational metrics
- `estimate_user_engagement()` - Update engagement factors

### Adding Tests
Extend `test_games.py` with new test functions:
```python
def test_new_game_logic(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Test new game logic."""
    # Your test implementation
    return results
```

## Integration with Platform

These Python tools are designed to work alongside the main MathWorld platform:

1. **Development Phase**: Use tools to analyze and test games
2. **Maintenance Phase**: Run regular backups and quality checks
3. **Enhancement Phase**: Get recommendations for improvements
4. **Testing Phase**: Validate game logic and mechanics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **File Not Found**: Ensure you're running from the correct directory
2. **Encoding Errors**: Make sure files are UTF-8 encoded
3. **Import Errors**: Install required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Getting Help

- Check the console output for error messages
- Verify file paths and permissions
- Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed
- Check that all required files exist

## Future Enhancements
